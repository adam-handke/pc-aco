Pairwise Comparisons-based Ant Colony Optimization

* Algorithm for solving multiple objective continuous optimization problems which allows taking into account user preferences in the form of pairwise comparisons.
* Based on the ant colony metaheuristic.
* The optimization is steered with user preferences towards more desired solutions.
* The preferences are expressed by pairwise comparisons which are translated into a value function preference model.
* Several value function approaches are implemented and compared.
* The performance of the algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark problems.
